@article{backprop,
	abstract = {We describe a new learning procedure, back-propagation, for networks of neurone-like units. The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal `hidden'units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.},

	abstract = {Dendrites on neurons integrate synaptic inputs to determine spike timing. Dendrites also convey back-propagating action potentials (bAPs), where these signals interact with synaptic inputs to strengthen or weaken individual synapses. To study dendritic integration and associative plasticity rules, we developed molecular, optical, and computational tools for all-optical electrophysiology in dendrites. We mapped sub-millisecond voltage dynamics throughout the dendritic trees of CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute brain slices. Our data show history-dependent bAP propagation in distal dendrites, driven by locally generated Na+ spikes (dSpikes). Dendritic depolarization led to a transient window for dSpike propagation, opened by A-type KV channel inactivation, and closed by slow NaV inactivation. Collisions of dSpikes with synaptic inputs triggered N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent plateau potentials. These results, combined with numerical simulations, paint an intuitive picture connecting dendritic biophysics to associative plasticity rules.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
